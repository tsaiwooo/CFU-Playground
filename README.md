# AAML_final project CFU Playground
- final project in the ```proj/AAML_final_project```
- run the command ```make prog & make load```

## Methods
- Systolic array
- double buffer

## Future Work
- im2col can be optimized to reduce the amount of transmitted data
- In cfu, filter data can be reused by storing them in buffer
